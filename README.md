# **Optimizing Bank Marketing Campaigns: A Prescriptive Approach**
This project applies prescriptive analytics to the UCI Bank Marketing dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) to recommend strategies for improving customer response rates in direct marketing campaigns. Using optimization techniques, decision analysis, and simulations, the goal is to provide actionable insights that help answer the question: "**What should we do next?**" 

The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that influence campaign success and suggesting ways to allocate resources effectively for optimal results.
